difference between gitclone and gitfork?
git fork : Makes a copy of a repo under your GitHub (or GitLab, etc.) account.
           Used when you want to contribute to someone else’s project but don’t            have write access.

git clone: Makes a local copy of a repo on your computer. 
           Used to work with any repo locally.
